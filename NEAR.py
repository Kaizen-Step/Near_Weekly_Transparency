NEAR Protocol is software that aims to incentivize a network of computers to operate a platform for developers to create and launch decentralized applications.  
Central to NEAR Protocol‚Äôs design is the concept of sharding, a process that aims to split the network‚Äôs infrastructure into several segments in order for computers, also known as nodes, to only have to handle a fraction of the network‚Äôs transactions.  
By distributing segments of the blockchain, rather than the complete blockchain across network participants, sharding is expected to create a more efficient way to retrieve network data and scale the platform.  
NEAR operates in a similar manner to other centralized data storage systems like Amazon Web Services (AWS) that serve as the base layer on which applications are built. But rather than being run by a single entity, NEAR is operated and maintained by a distributed network of computers.  
Just as AWS allows developers to deploy code in the cloud without needing to create their own infrastructure, NEAR Protocol facilitates a similar architecture built around a network of computers and its native cryptocurrency, the NEAR token.  

### The Importance of Transparency ###
  
The NEAR Foundation has been committed to transparency since its inception. It values openness to all stakeholders, including investors, builders, and creators. The Foundation‚Äôs focus on openness to the entire community will always be a core tenet.    
The Foundation values the community‚Äôs continued support and feedback as it publishes these reports. It‚Äôs part of the Foundation‚Äôs ongoing response to the community to provide as much transparency as possible.
In recent months, in response to community frustration, the Foundation has endeavored to do more.   
**NEAR‚Äôs mission is to:**   
**"Remove every barrier for Web3 creators, by creating an ecosystem that is uniquely simple, safe, scalable, and sustainable"**.  
Openness to the community, investors, builders, and creators is one of the core tenets of being a Web3 project.   
This NEAR Weekly On-Chain Data Report is just one of the ways in which the Foundation is being more proactively transparent. """)
